# 🌦️ Weather Dashboard

A modern, responsive **Weather Dashboard** built with **React + Vite** that displays current weather, forecasts, air quality, sunrise/sunset timings, and favorite cities.  
The app uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch real-time data and provides an intuitive UI with smooth gradients for day/night themes.
